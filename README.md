My IP Chrome Extension - geolocate by IP
----------------------------------------

This simple Chrome extension shows your external IP and then uses uses the [IPInfoDB API](http://ipinfodb.com/) to provide geolocation data, based on that IP.
You can download the extension from the [https://chrome.google.com/webstore](Chrome app store).

How does it work
================
This extension makes one call to a server side, that uses IPInfoDB to turn the IP into a result JSON.
You can find out more, including the source, at [https://github.com/TravelingTechGuy/myip](https://github.com/TravelingTechGuy/myip).

I used several open source apps to bootstrap and build this extension:
